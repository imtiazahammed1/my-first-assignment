                Initially, beginners enjoy making buttons, adding the links, adding images and a lot ofcool stuff in web
                designing but when it comes to making a project using only HTML and CSS they get stuck and confuse about
                what they should make to practice all these stuff. After all their knowledge is just limited to HTML and
                CSS. You need to check how HTML and CSS work together to design a beautiful frontend application. So the
                question is what are some beginner friendly projects you can build to practice everything you have
                learned.
