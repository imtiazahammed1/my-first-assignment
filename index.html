    <h3>Develop</h3>
    <h3>Without Limits</h3>
    <p>
        Initially, beginners enjoy making buttons, adding the links, adding images, working with layout and a lot of
        cool stuff in web designing but when it comes to making a project using only HTML and CSS they get stuck and
        confuse about what they should make to practice all these stuff. After all their knowledge is just limited to
        HTML and CSS. No matter what after learning everything at some point you will realize that making a project is
        important to practice HTML and CSS skills. You need to check how HTML and CSS work together to design a
        beautiful frontend application. So the question is what are some beginner friendly projects you can build to
        practice everything you have learned.
